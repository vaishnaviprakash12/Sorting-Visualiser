Introduction:-

The Sorting Visualizer project is a program that allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. It provides a graphical representation of how different sorting algorithms work and how they rearrange elements in a list to achieve a sorted order. 

Features:-

Visualization of popular sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.

Adjustable speed control to slow down or speed up the sorting process.

Randomized data generation for sorting demonstration.

Real-time visualization of the sorting process with colored bars representing the elements.

Technologies Used:-

HTML/CSS: The project's user interface is built using HTML and styled with CSS.

JavaScript: The sorting algorithms and visualization logic are implemented in JavaScript.
